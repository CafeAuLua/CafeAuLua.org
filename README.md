## Using the Gulp file

If you have ``gulp`` installed globally then replace where I write ``npx gulp`` with ``gulp``

This repo contains a live-preview package you can use.
To start the live preview with reloading on and web file change (``.scss``, ``.html``, ``.js``) run:
``npx gulp watch``

It will open up your browser and reload upon file changes. Any SCSS in ``scss/`` will also be recompiled & reloaded if changed.
